Draconium Preprocessor

Draconium is a templating language designed to let web site developers conform to style guidelines. As opposed to other templating languages which are based on the principle of "what you can do", draconium is based on "what you can not do".

Draconium is used to write HTML and enforces pre defined style guidelines.
For a very basic example, if you want to develop a style guideline which says that you can only have buttons which are either of the "primary" style or the "secondary" style. Now normally if you write a page with a button you are free to use these given styles, but you are also free to write your own CSS for the button. Draconium does not allow this. It will enforce this guideline letting developers only write code with primary or secondary buttons thus providing a consistency across the whole website.
